# bn128_bls

This Go package is for creating keyPairs for bls signature and generating BLS signatures.
**Note:** For simple usecase of bls signature you can check [https://github.com/dedis/kyber](https://github.com/dedis/kyber)

This package was created for generating bls signature using golang which later can be verified in smart contract.  
I have impleamened also implemented contract for verifying bls signature in smart contract, for that you can check [BLSForSolidity](https://github.com/vedupaji1/BLSForSolidity) repository.
